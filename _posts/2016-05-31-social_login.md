Login with Facebook, Twitter and Google

**Social Login**

Social login, also known as social sign­in, is a form of single sign­on using existing login information from a social networking service such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+ to sign into a third party website instead of creating a new login account specifically for that website.

**Login with facebook, Twitter and Google**

'Login with facebook' redirects you towards facebook login page, on entering corect credentials,facebook generates an access token, this token is verified using facebook API's. If valid, an access token is generated and the user is logged in to the application, also the user's email address is fetched from the facebook account and registered.Next time the user gets an option to login with the registered email and set an password for the same using 'forgot password link'.
	Similar steps are followed for login with Twitter and Google, in these cases Twitter and Google API's are used.

1. Targeted Content - Websites can obtain user's profile information.

2. Multiple Identities - Users can log in to websites with multiple social identities.

3. Registration Data - Speed up the registration or sign­up process.
