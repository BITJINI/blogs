So the Mobile era is here.

The number of mobile users are increasing day by day and are greater than the number of desktop users.  80% of time spent on mobile devices is spent using apps, leading to apps becoming the dominant form of digital interaction. 
Developing both mobile website and mobile app for your business can prove to be a costly affair. You might have to choose one of the two channels, based on your budget and business goals. The choice between mobile apps and websites depends on their cost, usability, required features and the audience they serve. While both channels have their own pros and cons, mobile apps especially, can help you get higher conversions. Businesses have realised the need to effectively use mobile channels for attracting customers and these apps can offer greater personalisation and operational efficiency, along with other multiple exclusive features.

This makes for a strong reason to have mobile apps for reaching out to potential and existing customers. With mobile app it's easy to treat users with personalised experience which can be curated for the users specific purposes to be actionable, and easily accessible in brief, spontaneous moments. Providing a more distinct engaging, efficient, and rich effective user experience, native apps have the advantage and capabilities which is a significant improvement over a responsive web site, thus saving the end-users time and frustration.

For example, if a student needs to visit a professor, he or she could visit a responsively-designed site, navigate to the directory, search for the professor, copy the phone number out to their phone to call the professor, return to the site to learn where the office is located, and copy that location into a mapping application, all from their phone.

 Alternately, the same student could open a native app, select the directory right from the home screen, tap to call from within the app, then tap on the office location pin and use the pathfinder to locate the office. All of this is accomplished quickly and efficiently within a consistent and immersive app experience, without having to switch between applications.

Users who encounter mobile web experiences that force them to tap, search, copy, and navigate too many times will often give up on their original task. The deep-linking capabilities of a native apps keep users focused, allowing them to complete their goal quickly and efficiently. 

In fact, these days you’ll notice that many small businesses you interact with in your everyday life, have their own dedicated mobile app, be it the corner coffee shop or the beauty parlour downtown. These companies are ahead of the game when it comes to taking their marketing and productivity to the next level.

Either way you go, a mobile app is going to be a standard component of any business in the future. The choice you make today is going set the foundation for the future of your business. It’s up to you to choose whether you’d like to be one of the first..
